Hi!

I’m Esther Mahoro, and in this project, I built a Python program to extract important data from big chunks of text using Regular Expressions (regex).

Here’s what I did:

I focused on finding email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and currency amounts from text data.

I wrote regex patterns to accurately capture these data types from messy strings.

I tested my code on sample text files to make sure it works well.

This project is useful because it helps automate finding key information quickly from lots of text, which can save time and reduce errors.

I had fun learning and applying regex in Python.
